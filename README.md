# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
**Overview:**

Classification model for Credit Card Default Prediction.Predicting defaulter based on demographics and repayment details

**Dataset:**

This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit
data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April
2005 to September 2005.Dataset link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RqrwJqwDTeDq7sy1IWCL3Z473Z4LpwiF/view

**Approach:**

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

**Technical Aspect:**

  1)Cleaning the data by deleting rows that has wrong values,deleting the columns which are not essential to predict the defaulters.

  2)Visualizing the data using various modules such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

  3)Built models such as Logistic Regression,K-Nearest Neighbor,Naive Bayes,Decision Tree,Random Forest,Gradient Boosting and XG Boost.Also evaluated each      model using AUROC score, to choose among them the best model.

Finally,done the feature importance of every model.

**Result:**

PAY_0,PAY_1,PAY_2,PAY_3,PAY_5 and PAY_6 as the most important feature to predict the defaulters.

**Technologies Used:**

Pandas

Google Colab Notebook

Matplotlib

Seaborn
